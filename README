NAME
    RDF::vCard - convert between RDF and vCard

SYNOPSIS
     use RDF::vCard;
     use RDF::TrineShortcuts qw(rdf_string);
 
     my $input    = "http://example.com/contact-data.rdf";
     my $exporter = RDF::vCard::Exporter->new;
 
     my $data     = join '', $exporter->export_cards($input);
     print $data; # vCard 3.0 data
 
     my $importer = RDF::vCard::Importer->new;
     $importer->import_string($data);
     print rdf_string($importer->model => 'RDFXML');

DESCRIPTION
    This module doesn't do anything itself; it just loads
    RDF::vCard::Exporter and RDF::vCard::Importer for you.

  RDF::vCard::Exporter
    RDF::vCard::Exporter takes some RDF using the W3C's vCard vocabulary,
    and outputs RDF::vCard::Entity objects.

  RDF::vCard::Importer
    RDF::vCard::Importer does the reverse.

  RDF::vCard::Entity
    An RDF::vCard::Entity objects is an individual vCard. It overloads
    stringification, so just treat it like a string.

  RDF::vCard::Entity::WithXmlSupport
    RDF::vCard::Entity::WithXmlSupport is a subclass of RDF::vCard::Entity,
    with a "to_xml" method. It requires XML::LibXML to be installed and
    working. The importer and exporter will try to create these if possible.

  RDF::vCard::Line
    RDF::vCard::Line is internal fu that you probably don't want to touch.

BUGS
    If your RDF asserts that Alice is Bob's AGENT and Bob is Alice's AGENT,
    then RDF::vCard::Export will eat your face. Don't do it.
